Hey everyone, this is just a small project idea I've had since my last job that I've decided to work on. At that job I had to convert a lot of Word Docs/PDFs to HTML which is a lot of copy/pasting but you also have to type up the code for that data. It can very tedious especially with tables where the original author of the table didn't design it for web in mind. That's where my idea for a web app to do the work for you came from.

This web app is a form that you would input the data from the table and it would output the HTML code. You would still need to copy/paste the data but this would take out the tedious aspect of making sure the table code is structured/formatted correctly. For now I'm going to try to keep the features basic but I do want to expand upon it in the future to include features like basic CSS styling and even saving what you have so far in the event you accidentally refresh.

Anyways check on this space from time to time for updates! :smile:
